# 🚀 CREATE GITHUB REPO & DEPLOY - STEP BY STEP

## ✅ STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

### A. Go to GitHub
Open this link in your browser: **https://github.com/new**

(If you don't have a GitHub account, first sign up at: https://github.com/signup)

### B. Fill in Repository Details:

**Repository name:** `aaryan-editz-website`

**Description (optional):** Professional Video & Photo Editing Platform - Aaryan Editz

**Visibility:** Choose one:
- ✅ **Public** (Recommended - Free deployment, anyone can see code)
- ⭕ **Private** (Code hidden, but free tier has limits)

**IMPORTANT:** 
- ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
- ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore
- ❌ **DO NOT** choose a license

### C. Click "Create repository"

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with instructions.

**Copy the HTTPS URL** - it looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aaryan-editz-website.git
```

Example:
- If your GitHub username is `abhishekgajula`, the URL would be:
  `https://github.com/abhishekgajula/aaryan-editz-website.git`

**WRITE DOWN YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE:**

## ✅ STEP 3: Tell Me Your GitHub Username

Once you've created the repository, tell me:

**"My GitHub username is: YOUR_USERNAME"**

Then I'll help you push the code automatically! 🚀

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Problem:** Don't have GitHub account
**Solution:** Go to https://github.com/signup and create one (it's free!)

**Problem:** Not sure about Public vs Private
**Recommendation:** Choose **Public** for free unlimited deployment

**Problem:** Repository name already taken
**Solution:** Use a different name like:
- `aaryan-editz`
- `aaryaneditz-website`
- `video-editing-portfolio`

## 📱 After You Create the Repo:

Just tell me your GitHub username and I'll:
1. ✅ Push your code to GitHub
2. ✅ Help you deploy to Vercel
3. ✅ Get your website live in minutes!

**NOTE: YOUR CODE IS STILL SAFE ON YOUR COMPUTER**
I won't push anything until you're ready! 😊
